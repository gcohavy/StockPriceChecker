To make it work, you must connect to the DataBase.
1) Create a .env file and set DB to your mongo connection string
2) To run the tests, set NODE_ENV=test in that same .env file

Work Done:
1) Created controller for data gathering: `getData.js`, and created the routing: `api.js`
2) Added Security features to `server.js`
3) Created all of the functional tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js`
